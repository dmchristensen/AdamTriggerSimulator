# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be cool to each other. This is a hobby project and we're all here to help each other out with ADAM device testing.

## The Slightly Longer Version

This is pretty straightforward:

**Do:**
- Be respectful and helpful
- Remember everyone is at different experience levels
- Help others learn
- Give constructive feedback
- Ask questions if something isn't clear

**Don't:**
- Be rude or insulting
- Harass people
- Spam or troll
- Share other people's private info

That's it. Just treat people how you'd want to be treated.

## If There's a Problem

This is a small project, so if someone's being problematic:
1. Open a GitHub issue or discussion about it
2. I'll take a look and handle it

Most issues can be resolved with a simple conversation. In extreme cases, people might get blocked from the project.

## Questions?

Not sure about something? Just open a discussion and ask. I'd rather clarify than have people worried about making mistakes.

Basically: This is a chill, helpful community. Let's keep it that way!
